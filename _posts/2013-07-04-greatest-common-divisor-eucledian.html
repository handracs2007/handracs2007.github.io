Greatest Common Divisor (GCD for short) is the largest positive integer that divides two numbers. In other words, the greatest common divisor of <i>a</i>&nbsp;and <i>b</i>&nbsp;is, as its name suggests, the largest positive integer <i>d</i>&nbsp;such that <i>d</i>&nbsp;| <i>a</i>&nbsp;and <i>d</i>&nbsp;| <i>b</i>.&nbsp;In this post, we will see how we can calculate GCD efficiently using an algorithm that is known as <b>Eucledian Algorithm</b>.<br /><br />The key thing in this algorithm is <i>division with remainder</i>, which is simply the method of "long division" that you learned in elementary school. Thus if <i>a</i>&nbsp;and <i>b</i>&nbsp;are positive integers and if you attempt to divide <i>a</i>&nbsp;by <i>b</i>, you will get a quotient <i>q</i>&nbsp;and a reminder <i>r</i>.<br /><br />Below is the theorem used for this algorithm:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Let <i>a</i>&nbsp;and <i>b</i>&nbsp;be positive integers with a &gt;= b. The following algorithm computes gcd(a,b) in a finite number of steps.<br />(1) Let r<sub>0</sub> = a and r<sub>1</sub> = b<br />(2) Set i = 1<br />(3) Divide r<sub>i-1</sub> by r<sub>i</sub> to get a quotient q<sub>i</sub> and remainder r<sub>i+1</sub>, r<sub>i-1</sub> = r<sub>i</sub>.q<sub>i</sub> + r<sub>i+1</sub> with 0 &lt;= r<sub>i+1</sub> &lt;= r<sub>i</sub><br />(4) If the remainder r<sub>i+1</sub> = 0, then r<sub>i</sub>=gcd(a,b) and the algorithm terminates.<br />(5) Otherwise, r<sub>i+1</sub> &gt; 0, so set i = i + 1 and go to Step 3.</blockquote>Below is the sample source code on how it is implemented using the C programming language<br /><br /><pre class="prettyprint lang-c">int gcd ( int number1 , int number2 )<br />{<br />    if ( number2 == 0 )<br />        return number1 ;<br />    else<br />        return gcd ( number2 , number1 % number2 ) ;<br />}<br /></pre><br />Hope it helps anyone who needs it. Happy Programming :)
