Just read this, again, from the Internet. Nice story to share.<br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><span href="http://mbstories.quora.com/Priorities#" id="__w2_Y0yY5qS_toggle_link"><span id="ld_Bd3cjt_2741"><span class="inline_editor_value">When things in your life seem almost too much to handle,<br />When 24 hours in a day is not enough,<br />Remember the mayonnaise jar and 2 cups of coffee.<br /><br />A professor stood before his philosophy class<br />And had some items in front of him.<br />When the class began, wordlessly,<br />He picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar<br />and proceeded to fill it with golf balls.<br /><br />He then asked the students, if the jar was full.<br />They agreed that it was.<br /><br />The professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured<br />them into the jar. He shook the jar lightly.<br />The pebbles rolled into the open Areas between the golf balls.<br /><br />He then asked the students again if the jar was full. They agreed it was.<br /><br />The professor next picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar.<br />Of course, the sand filled up everything else.<br />He asked once more if the jar was full. The students responded with a unanimous 'yes.'<br /><br />The professor then produced two cups of coffee from under the table and poured the entire contents into the jar, effectively<br />filling the empty space between the sand. The students laughed.<br /><br />'Now,' said the professor, as the laughter subsided,<br />'I want you to recognize that this jar represents your life.<br />The golf balls are the important things - family,<br />children, health, Friends, and Favorite passions.<br />Things that if everything else was lost and only they remained, Your life would still be full.<br /><br />The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, house, and car.<br /><br />The sand is everything else --The small stuff.<br /><br />'If you put the sand into the jar first,' He continued,<br />'there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls.<br />The same goes for life.<br /><br />If you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff,<br />You will never have room for the things that are important to you.<br /><br />So...<br /><br />Pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness.<br />Play with your children.<br />Take time to get medical checkups.<br />Take your partner out to dinner.<br /><br />There will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal.<br /><br />'Take care of the golf balls first --<br />The things that really matter.<br />Set your priorities. The rest is just sand.'<br /><br />One of the students raised her hand and inquired what the coffee represented.<br /><br />The professor smiled.<br />'I'm glad you asked'.<br /><br />It just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem,<br />there's always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend.'</span></span></span></blockquote>
