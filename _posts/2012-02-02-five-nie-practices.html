In other words, IT does something to fulfil the need of business. This is the traditional way of managing IT. There is demand, then there is supply.</div><div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><b>Innovation</b></div><div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">Innovation is fundamentally different from Strategic Demand/Supply Planning. In the innovation process, IT drives new business initiatives.</div><div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><b>Prioritisation</b></div><div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">Prioritisation is the process where the initiatives of IT is being prioritised against the business necessity. The prioritisation practice is very important to make sure that resources are spent on the right places and the right time to produce right bottom-line impact.</div><div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><b>Alignment</b></div><div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">The alignment process is the process where company determines the correct activity that support its business activity. The prioritisation and alignment process are two processes that are connected. We align what we do and we do the highest priority first.</div><div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><br /></div><div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;"><b>Performance Measurement</b></div><div style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif;">All too often, company just do some initiatives without doing measurement of success. This can lead to poor performance and waste of resources. In the NIE practices, the performance measurement is an indispensable part of IT initiatives. All initiatives must be measured for success.</div>
