<span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Just recently, a news spread about a young lady, died due to attack of a Needle fish. The story began when she was having a vacation with her family at Tanjung Karang beach, Makassar, Indonesia. This unfortunate event happened on January 01, 2016.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X98b5xaV79E/VpBjd3RZ0LI/AAAAAAAAKnQ/hJsWyOa-ABc/s1600/Liena.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-X98b5xaV79E/VpBjd3RZ0LI/AAAAAAAAKnQ/hJsWyOa-ABc/s1600/Liena.jpg" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: small;">Liena</span></td></tr></tbody></table><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Liena (39) was soaking her body near the shoreline, whilst suddenly a needlefish jump towards her face. She was not able to dodge because it was too sudden. The fish, known with its long sharp and spear like snout, pierced through her right eyelids. She was then screaming for help. Her husband's family was then run to help her. She was quite badly injured. The wound was so deep that it even pierced through the skull and caused her to vomit blood.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">She was brought to the hospital by ambulance to Kabelota Donggala hospital. Nevertheless, the wound was so bad that she eventually could not make it. She passed away in that hospital and the corpse was brought back to Balaikota Palu.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Needlefish_is_being_cleaned_by_Labroides_phthirophagus.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="161" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Needlefish_is_being_cleaned_by_Labroides_phthirophagus.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Needlefish</td></tr></tbody></table><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">It's highly advised that we are keep being careful when playing around the beach.
