## Welcome to my site
This site's main purpose is to throw in all the nerdy stuffs I encountered during my daily life. Sometimes, I might just thrown in some not-so-nerdy contents, depending on my mood.

With this site, I have retired my [existing blog](https://handracs.blogspot.com) hosted in Google Blogspot. New blog posts will be posted here and also duplicated at my [Medium](https://medium.com/@handra) page.

## Contact
If you want to contact me, feel free to email me at: [handra@handracs.info](mailto:handra@handracs.info).

Cheers
